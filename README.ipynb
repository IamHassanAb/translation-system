    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Docker**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.\n",
    "   - **Ubuntu**: You can install Docker by following the official [Docker installation guide for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).\n",
    "   - **Windows**: Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pip**: Ensure you have `pip` installed to manage Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **VSCode** (optional): For a better development experience, you can use Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting Up RabbitMQ\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pull the RabbitMQ Docker Image**:\n",
    "   Open your terminal and run the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker pull rabbitmq:management\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the RabbitMQ Container**:\n",
    "   After pulling the image, run the RabbitMQ server with the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   docker run -d --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:management\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The RabbitMQ management interface will be accessible at `http://localhost:15672` (default username: `guest`, password: `guest`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Serving the Frontend\n",
    "\n",
    "You can serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JS) in the frontend folder using either of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using VSCode Server Extension**:\n",
    "   - Open the frontend folder in VSCode.\n",
    "   - Use the Live Server extension to serve the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Python's HTTP Server**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to the frontend directory in your terminal:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd path/to/frontend\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Run the following command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m http.server\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the Backend Services\n",
    "\n",
    "The backend consists of three services: app, language detection, and translation. You need to run each service separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Run the App Service**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to the app directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd backend/app\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Start the service with:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python main.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Language Detection Service**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to the language detection directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd backend/language_detection\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Start the service with:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python main.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run the Translation Service**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to the translation directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd backend/translation\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - Start the service with:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python main.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After following these steps, your application should be up and running. You can access the frontend and interact with the language detection and translation services. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the logs in your terminal for debugging information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Happy coding!\n"
